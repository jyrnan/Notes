# Vapor

In addition to the HTTP method helpers, there is an `on` function that accepts HTTP method as an input parameter.

### Path Component[¶](https://docs.vapor.codes/basics/routing/#path-component)

Each route registration method accepts a variadic list of `PathComponent`. This type is expressible by string literal and has four cases:

- Constant (`foo`)
- Parameter (`:foo`)
- Anything (``)
- Catchall (`*`)
