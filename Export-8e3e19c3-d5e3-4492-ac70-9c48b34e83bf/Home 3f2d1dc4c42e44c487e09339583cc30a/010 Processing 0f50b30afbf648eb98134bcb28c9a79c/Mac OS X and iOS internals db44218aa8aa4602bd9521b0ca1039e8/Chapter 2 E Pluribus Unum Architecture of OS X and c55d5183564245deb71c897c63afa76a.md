# Chapter 2 E Pluribus Unum: Architecture of OS X and iOS

# OS X Architectural Overview

![Untitled](Chapter%202%20E%20Pluribus%20Unum%20Architecture%20of%20OS%20X%20and%20c55d5183564245deb71c897c63afa76a/Untitled.png)

# The user Experience Layer

## Aqua

The system's first user-mode process, launchd (which is covered in great depth in Chapter 6) is responsible for starting the GUI. 

## Quicklook

**Bundle**:For now, suffice it to consider a bundle as a directory hierarchy conforming to a fixed structure.

**UTI**: Uniform Type Identifier, which is essentially just reverse DNS notation.

The idea of using the same namespace for software originated with Java. To prevent namespace conflict, **Sun (now Oracle)** noted that DNS can be used ‚Äî albeit in reverse ‚Äî to provide a hierarchy that closely resembles a file system.

## Spotlight

The brain behind spotlight is an indexing server, mds, located in the MetaData framework, which is part of the system's core services.(/`System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/Metadata.framework/Support/mds)`. This is a daemon with no GUI. 

Every time a file operation occurs ‚Äî creation, modification, or deletion ‚Äî the kernel notifies this daemon. This notification mechanism, called `fsevents`, 

Another little documented feature is controlling Spotlight (particularly, mds) by creating files in various paths: For example, creating a .metadata_never_index hidden file in a directory will prevent its indexing (originally designed for removable media).

# Darwin - The Unix Core

Leopard (10.5) was the first version of OS X to be UNIX-certified. 

## The Shell

Either telnet or SSH can be easily enabled on OS X by editing the appropriate property list file (telnet.plist, or ssh.plist) in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons. Simply set the Disabled key to false, (or remove it altogether). 

# UNIX System Directories

- **/bin:** Unix binaries. This is where the common UNIX commands (for example, ls, rm, mv, df) are.
- /**sbin**: System binaries. These are binaries used for system administration, such as file-system management, network configuration, and so on.
- /**usr**: The User directory. This is not meant for users, but is more like Windows' program files in that third-party software can install here.
- /**usr**: Contains in it bin, sbin, and lib. /usr/lib is used for shared objects (think, Windows DLLs and \windows\system32). This directory also contains the include/ subdirectory, where all the standard C headers are.
- /**etc**: Et Cetera. A directory containing most of the system configuration files; for example, the password file (/etc/passwd). In OS X, this is a symbolic link to /private/etc.
- /**dev**: BSD device files. These are special files that represent hardware devices on the system (character and block devices).
- /**tmp**: Temporary directory. The only directory in the system that is world-writable (permissions: rwxrwxrwx). In OS X, this is a symbolic link to /private/tmp.
- /**var**: Various. A directory for log files, mail store, print spool, and other data. In OS X, this is a symbolic link to /private/var.

## OS X-Specific Directories

- /**Applications**: Default base for all applications in system.
- /**Developer:If** XCode is installed, the default installation point for all developer tools.
- /**Library**: Data files, help, documentation, and so on for system applications.
- /**Network**: Virtual directory for neighbor node discovery and access.
- /**System**: Used for System files. It contains only a Library subdirectory, but this directory holds virtually every major component of the system, such as frameworks (/System/Library/Frameworks), kernel modules (/System/Library/Extensions), fonts, and so on.
- /**Users**: Home directory for users. Every user has his or her own directory created here.
- /**Volumes**: Mount point for removable media and network file systems.
- /**Cores**: Directory for core dumps, if enabled. Core dumps are created when a process crashes, if the ulimit(1) command allows it, and contain the core virtual memory image of the process. Core dumps are discussed in detail in Chapter 4, ‚ÄúProcess Debugging.

## iOS File System Idiosyncrasies

- /**Applications** may be a symbolic link to /var/stash/Applications. This is a feature of the jailbreak, not of iOS.
- There is no /Users, but a /User ‚Äî which is a symbolic link to /var/mobile
- There is no /Volumes (and no need for it,  or for disk arbitration, as iOS doesn't have any way to add more storage to a given system)
- /**Developer** is populated only if the i-Device is selected as ‚ÄúUse for development‚Äù from within XCode. In those cases, the DeveloperDiskImage.dmg included in the iOS SDK is mounted onto the device.

# Interlude: Bundles

<aside>
üí° The term ‚Äúbundle‚Äù is actually used to describe two different terms in Mac OS: The first is the directory structure described in this section (also sometimes called ‚Äúpackage‚Äù). The second is a file object format of a shared-library object which has to be explicitly loaded by the process (as opposed to normal libraries, which are implicitly loaded). This is also sometimes referred to as a plug-in.

</aside>

Apple defines bundles as ‚Äúa standardized hierarchical structure that holds executable code and the resources used by that code.‚Äù

# Applications and Apps

## iOS‰∏äÂéüÁîüÂíåÂÆâË£ÖÁöÑÂå∫Âà´Ôºö

Additionally, iOS distinguishes between the default applications provided by Apple, which reside in /Applications (or /var/stash/Applications in older jailbreak-versions of iOS), and App Store purchased ones, which are in /var/mobile/Applications. 

When downloaded from the App Store (or elsewhere), applications are packaged as an .ipa file. this is really nothing more than a zip file (and may be opened with unzip(1))

## info.plist

The Info.plist file, which resides in the Contents/ subdirectory of Applications (and of most other bundles), holds the bundle's metadata. 

Property lists are stored in one of three formats:

- XML
- Binary
- JSON

## CodeResources

‚ÄúThe last important file an application contains is CodeResources, which is a symbolic link to _CodeSignature/CodeResources.‚Äù

‚ÄúA system administrator or power user can access and manipulate defaults using the defaults(1) command ‚Äî a generally preferable approach to direct editing of the plist files.‚Äù

## Top Level Frameworks

### Carbon

Carbon is the name given to the OS 9 legacy programming interfaces. Carbon has been declared deprecated, though many applications, including Apple's own, still rely on it. Even though many of its interfaces are specifically geared for OS 9 compatibility, many new interfaces have been added into it, and it shows no sign of disappearing.

### Cocoa

Cocoa is the preferred application programming environment. It is the modern day incarnation of the NeXTSTEP environment, as is evident by the prefix of many of its base classes ‚Äî **NS**, short for NeXTSTEP/Sun. The preferred language for programming with Cocoa is Objective C, although it can be accessed from Java and AppleScript as well.

## BSD/Mach Native

Though the preferred language for both iOS and OS X is Objective-C, native applications may be coded in C/C++, and may choose to forego frameworks, working directly with the system libraries and the low-level interfaces of BSD and Mach instead.

> ‚Äú**Portable Operating System Interface**, more commonly known as POSIX‚Äù
> 
- **System call prototypes**: All POSIX system calls, regardless of underlying implementation, have the same prototype .This ensures that POSIX-compatible code can be ported ‚Äî at the source level ‚Äî between any POSIX compatible operating system.
- **System call numbers:** The key POSIX functions, in addition to the fixed prototype, have well-defined system call numbers. OS X does not support this, however, because its object format, Mach-O, is incompatible with ELF. What's more, its system call numbers deviate from those of the standard.

## Mach System Calls

# A High-Level View of XNU

The core of Darwin, and of all of OS X, is its Kernel, XNU. XNU  is itself made up of several components:

- The Mach microkernel
- The BSD layer
- libKern
- I/O Kit

## Mach

Mach **microkernel,** which handles only the most primitive responsibilities of the operating system: ÂæÆÂÜÖÊ†∏ÁöÑ‰ΩúÁî®

- Process and thread abstractions
- Virtual memory management
- Task scheduling
- Interprocess communication and messaging

Any additional functionality, such as file and device access, has to be implemented on top of it ‚Äî and that is exactly what the BSD layer does.

## The BSD Layer

The BSD layer provides higher-level abstractions, including, among others:

- The UNIX Process model
- The POSIX threading model (Pthread) and its related synchronization primitives
- UNIX Users and Groups
- The Network stack (BSD Socket API)
- File system access
- Device access (through the /dev directory)

## libkern

## I/O KitÔºöÂà©Áî®C++ÁºñÁ®ãÂèàÂø´ÂèàÂ•Ω ÔºöÔºâ

Apple's most important modification to XNU was the introduction of the I/O Kit device-driver framework. This is a complete, self-contained execution environment in the kernel, which enables developers to quickly create device drivers that are both elegant and stable. It achieves that by establishing a restricted **C++** environment (of libkern), with the most important functionality offered by the language ‚Äî **inheritance and overloading.**
