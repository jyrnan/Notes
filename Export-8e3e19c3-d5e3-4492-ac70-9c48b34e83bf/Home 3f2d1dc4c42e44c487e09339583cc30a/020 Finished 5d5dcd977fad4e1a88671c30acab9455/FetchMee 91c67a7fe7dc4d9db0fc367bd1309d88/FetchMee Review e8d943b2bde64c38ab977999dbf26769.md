# FetchMee Review

**FetchMee**

这是一个用户界面简洁的推特实用工具

除了在主界面显示您推文相关信息

它的主要功能是方便您发送较长的推文

它还可以帮助您用昵称标记喜爱的用户

它可以在后台帮助您删除推文

您也可以用它来浏览推文，回复或收藏推文以及一些其他基本功能。

它很安全，不会保存任何账户相关信息到应用中

感谢审核人的工作。

FetchMee是基于twitter api的访问在用户授权下实现对用户其所拥有的Twitter账户信息进行被允许范围内的操作，例如读取，发布推文。

FetchMee是通过Twitter所公布的api来实现其功能，这个名为FetchMee的Twitter api是FetchMee开发者在符合Twitter Developer条款下申请的，开发者有使用这个api的权利。开发者是用本人Twitter账户 @jyrnan 申请了这个api。 app通过api获取的任何用户信息均是在Twitter api访问的许可范围之内。用户通过app发布的信息也将完全是用户本人意愿。

@FetchMee 是一个用来在APP审核过程中做演示的账户，无法申请两步认证，因此Twitter可能会在登录过程中出于安全原因导致其无法登录。审核者可以通过任意可登录的Twitter账户来了解App的使用情况。

关于@Fetchmee 账户信息和名为FetchMee的twitter api情况均有截图。

如果需要其他任何信息，请知会。

谢谢。

Dear reviewers:

Thanks to the reviewers for your work.

FetchMee is based on the access to the twitter api which allows user to do what user are allowed to do with the twitter account information, such as read and post tweets, with your permission.

FetchMee is made available through a Twitter app(api) called FetchMee, which is applied by the FetchMee developer in accordance with the Twitter Developer Terms and Conditions, with the right to use the app(api). The developer applied for the app(api) using his Twitter account @jyrnan. @jyrnan is the personal twitter account of developer. Any user information that the app obtains through the app(api) is within the scope of the Twitter app(api)'s permission to access. Any information that a user publishes through FetchMee will be entirely of the user's own volition.

@FetchMee is an account used to make presentations during the app's review process and cannot be set for two-step authentication, so this account may not be able to log in during the login process and restricted by Twitter for security reasons. Reviewers can use any available Twitter account to see how the app is being used.

There are several screenshots of the @Fetchmee account information and of the twitter api named FetchMee.

If you need any other information, please let me know.

Thank you.

我是一个新手开发者，所以有一些可能不合适的地方。谢谢你们耐心的审核。

Dear reviewer:

Could you tell me more information about “documentary evidence ievidencing that you have all necessary rights or permissions to request, display, or distribute account information in your application. “

In the app, user will be presented with a consent dialog from Twitter asking user to authorize the app to use user’s account or user may be prompted to grant the app access to the Twitter accounts on. The authorization is provided by Twitter.

User can **review the various permissions** user are granting to the app.

All necessary rights or permissions request, display, or distribute account information in application was given only  after user had signed in to Twitter and authorized application to get those permissions.

Thanks for your reviewing work.
