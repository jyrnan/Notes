# Essential of Animation

# Key Points

- SwiftUI animations are driven by state changes. The change of a value that affects

a view.

- **View transitions** are animations applied to views when SwiftUI inserts or

removes them.

- **Linear animations** represent a constant-paced animation between two values.
- **Eased animations** apply acceleration, deceleration or both to the animation.
- **Spring animations** use a physics-based model of a spring.
- You can delay or change the speed of animations.
- Most animations should last between 0.25 and 1.0 seconds in length. Shorter

animations often arenâ€™t noticeable, while longer animations risk annoying your

user who just wants to get something done.

- View transitions can animate by opacity, scale or movement. You can use different

transitions for the insertion and removal of views.
