# Two Types of DataBases

divided into 2 types:

- relational
- non-relational

**Relational**: Relational database store their data in structured tables with defined columns. They are efficient at storing and queuing data whose structure is known up front. You created and query tables with a **structured query language(SQL)** that allows you to retrieve data from multiple, related tables. For example, if you have a list of pests in one table and list of owners in another, you can retrieve a list of pets with their ownersâ€™ names with single query.

**Non-relational:** a way of storing large amounts of unstructured data. Social networkings can store settings, images, locations, statuses and metrics all in a single document.
